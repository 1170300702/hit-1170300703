First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute!

1、As much as possible, try to follow the existing format of markdown and code.



2、If you want to Contributing New Algorithms:
  Make your pull requests to be specific and focused. 
  Instead of contributing "several algorithms" all at once contribute them all one by one separately 
  (i.e. one pull request for "Logistic Regression", another one for "K-Means" and so on).
